# Austin Crime Analysis

Our group sought to uncover trends in crimes reported to Austin Police Department. Data was obtained from the city's public API to access all official police reports recorded in Austin throughout 2017. We then used various Python libraries to analyze the data and create visualizations of our findings. Some of the answers were sought to uncover include: 
* How do crime rates differ in high-income zip codes vs. in low-income zip codes?
* How has crime evolved over the years as Austin continues to grow?
* Which days/months/holidays have the most occurrences of crime?

See included PowerPoint for summary of key findings and visualizations.
